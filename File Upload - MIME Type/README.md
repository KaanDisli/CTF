We have access to a photo gallery that allows us to upload images of type .jpg .gif and .png
Our goal is to achieve RME by uploading a php file and reading the content of the .passwd file to get the flag


First I uploaded a random image to see how it works

Once uploaded the server loads the image for you to view in the upload menu

Now we open  Burp Suite to upload a php file, we must keep ' Content-Type:image/jpeg ' to bypass the filter

this is what I tried first but there is no file named .passwd in the current directory. We have to move up 3 directories but the file is hidden so we use ls -a instead

so the final code is:
![720e72c8ff17b3bec3421d8323747a31](https://github.com/KaanDisli/CTF/assets/96348553/ea781cac-ed20-4afc-b392-b0b2a525f84a)



the flag: a7n4nizpgQgnPERy89uanf6T4
